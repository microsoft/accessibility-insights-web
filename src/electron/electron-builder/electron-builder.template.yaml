# electron-userland/electron-builder#2199 suggests we should produce a zip using electron-builder
# even if we do not use it (for auto-update to work) but that actually leads to issues when updating
# (accessibility-insights-web/3942#issuecomment-1090857396). As such, we only build the dmg with
# electron-builder and build the zip ourselves.
