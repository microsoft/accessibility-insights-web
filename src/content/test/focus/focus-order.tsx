            When users navigate through a web page, they expect to encounter controls and other content in an order that makes sense and
            makes it easy to use the page's functionality. Poor focus order can be disorienting to people who use screen readers or screen

        <h3>From a user's perspective</h3>
        <p>
            <Markup.Emphasis>
                "I use a keyboard and a screen reader to navigate content and operate software. When creating solutions, organize content
                and controls so that I can understand the presentation, meaning and operation of the interface by the order in which
                information is presented. To 'see' it like I do, write down the text and controls in the order required to complete the
                task. Next, read the sequence out loud. If it doesnâ€™t make sense to you, it is likely to confuse me and many other people."

        <h2>How to fix</h2>
        <p>Ensure interactive components receive focus in a logical, usable order.</p>

        <h2>Example</h2>
        <Markup.PassFail
            failText={
                <div>
                    <p>
                        A web form is organized as two columns. The first column allows users to provide their contact information (name,
                        address, phone, etc.). The second column allows users to select topics of interest to them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The visual presentation suggests users should provide their contact information before selecting topics. The first
                        column's content appears first in the DOM, followed by the second column's content.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, in a misguided belief that focus order must follow a left-to-right / top-to-bottom reading order, tabindex
                        values have been added so that focus moves back and forth between the two columns as the user tabs.
                    </p>
                </div>
            }
            passText={
                <p>
                    Tabindex values have been removed. Now Tabbing moves focus through all the content in the first column before moving it
                    to the second column.
                </p>
            }
        />
