            When interacting with a website or web app using a keyboard, users need to know which
            component currently has the input focus. By default, web browsers indicate focus
            visually, but custom programming, styles, style sheets, and scripting can disrupt it.
        </p>
        <p>
            When navigating sequentially through a user interface, keyboard users need to encounter
            information in an order that preserves its meaning and allows them to perform all
            supported functions.
