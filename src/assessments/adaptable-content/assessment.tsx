        <p>
            In general, larger fonts and ample spacing make it easier to read text, especially for
            people with low vision, dyslexia, or presbyopia. A 2018 study found that 1.8 billion
            people worldwide have presbyopia. (All people are affected by presbyopia to some degree
            as they age.)
        </p>
        <p>
            People with low vision use high contrast mode to ease eye strain or to make the screen
            easier to read by removing extraneous information.
        </p>
        <p>
            People with low vision and people who need cognitive assistance benefit from increased
            text size.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many factors affect peoples' ability to discern between colors/shades, including screen
            brightness, ambient light, age, color blindness, and some types of low vision.
