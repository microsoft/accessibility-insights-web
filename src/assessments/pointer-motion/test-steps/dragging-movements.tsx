                    Examine the target page to identify elements that support dragging (such as
                    press and hold, repositioning of pointer, releasing the pointer at end point).

                    Scrolling a page is not in scope, nor is using a technique such as CSS overflow
                    to make a section of content scrollable. This criterion also applies to web
                    content that interprets pointer actions (i.e. this does not apply to actions
                    that are required to operate the user agent or assistive technology).
